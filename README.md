# REGoth [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/50yputp2qe764sg2/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/degenerated1123/regoth) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/REGoth-project/REGoth.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/REGoth-project/REGoth) [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/REGoth/Lobby)
OpenSource-Reimplementation of the zEngine, used by the game "Gothic" and "Gothic II".

# Attention!
**The project was restarted and abandoned by the original group. bsFramework was abandoned at the end of 2019 and i guess the effort to both mantain bsFramework and REGoth was too much. Restarted and abandoned repository: https://github.com/REGoth-project/REGoth-bs**

**I am looking at the source code to understand if i can remove some duplicated math and hoping that one day bullet3 compiles without 10.000 warnings.**

Don't forget to check out the [REGoth-Wiki](../../wiki) for more information about the project!

A list showing the current state of the engine, can be found [here](../../wiki/state).

# Source
Make sure to clone this repository with the `--recursive` flag:

##### ssh:
```sh
git clone --recursive git@github.com:degenerated1123/REGoth.git
```

##### https:
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/degenerated1123/REGoth.git
```

To update the repo, you need to make sure to update the submodules as well. Instead of simply pulling the repository, you can do:
```sh
git pull --recurse-submodules
```

# Building

> Note: If you are missing packages or are having trouble building on your platform, you can check out this [wiki-page](../../wiki/how-to-build), which may contain more detailed instructions.
> If you don't find your platform there, I'd kindly ask you to add some instructions for other people to that wiki-page!

You will need CMake (3.1 or newer) and a C++14-capable compiler.
Currently supported/tested are:
 - GCC (6.x)
 - MinGW
 - Visual Studio 2015, 2017

You will also need a copy of `libsndfile` installed on your computer.

## Obtaining `libsndfile` and `libxinerama`

### *nix systems (Linux, BSD, macOS)
On most *nix systems, this can be obtained using a package manager, for example on Debian/Ubuntu:

```sh
$ sudo apt install libsndfile1-dev libasound2-dev
$ sudo apt install libxinerama-dev
```

Or on macOS

```sh
$ brew install libsndfile # Needs Homebrew
```

### Windows
`libsndfile` will need to be compiled separately. Create a directory somewhere on your system to store the compiled files, then run

    mkdir build-libsndfile
    cd build-libsndfile
    cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=compiled/files/folder path/to/REGoth/lib/libdmusic/utils/dls2sf/lib/libsndfile
    cmake --build . --target install --config Release

## Compiling REGoth

Then:
```sh
cd path/to/REGoth
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. # On *nix systems this is sufficient
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=compiled/files/folder .. # On Windows
```
> If CMake complains about some folders missing a CMakeLists.txt, you most likely forgot to clone with the `--recursive`-flag!
> Simple do `git submodule update --init --recursive` and it should work.


Then, choose depending on your OS:

### Linux, MacOS and other *nix
```sh
make -j4
```

### Windows
Starting Visual Studio 2017 you can use the integrated cmake functionality to open the cloned folder.  
Check out the [how to build wiki page](../../wiki/how-to-build) for details on this.

For previous versions of Visual Studio, open the generated `REGoth.sln` and build as usual.  
Alternatively, you may run this command inside of the build folder:
```sh
cmake --build . --config release
```



# Running
The compiled files are inside the `build/bin` directory.

Make sure to copy the `content/shaders` folder to the working directory of the compiled `REGoth`-Executable.
Then, run the program with the following flags:
```sh
REGoth -g "path/to/gothic1or2" -w startworld.zen
```

Where `path/to/gothic1or2` points to the root of a Gothic I or II installation and `startworld.zen` is one of the Zen-Files found in a `.vdf`-files in the games `data/`-directory. For example: `newworld.zen` or `addonworld.zen` for Gothic II.

> It is recommended to run this from the commandline, to see the debug-output of the program.

Additionally, for a list of possible commands, run `REGoth --help`.

# Controls

 * Movement: WASD/QE or arrow-keys (Space or Shift to run faster)
 * Actions: Left CTRL for everything
 * Menus: B for status-screen
 * Console: F10
   * Available commands (square brackets mean optional argument):
      * `tp [<teleporter:default=player>] <target>`: Teleport NPC `teleporter` (= player if none is given) to NPC `target`
      * `goto waypoint <waypoint>`: Teleport player to `waypoint`
      * `kill [<npc>]`: Kill `npc` or a nearby NPC if none is given
      * `knockout [<npc>]`: Knockout `npc` or a nearby NPC if none is given
      * `save <slotindex>`: Save the game to the given slot
      * `load <slotindex>`: Load the game from the given slot
      * `switchlevel <zenfile>`: Switch to an other level in current session
      * `usemana <amount>`: Use mana
      * `hurtself <amount>`: Hurt yourself
      * `set clock <hour> [<min:default=0>]`: Set time of day to `hour`:`min`
      * `control <npc>`: Take control over `npc`
      
# Development

If you want to help out and don't know where to start, I suggest reading the [wiki-page](../../wiki), which contains information about the engine-layout and lists of which features are missing (Not yet, though!).
